# CS630-HCI-Final-Project
This repository is created as a code reference for Graduation Project Mid Term Report. This project was completed as a part of course - CS630 Current Topics Human Comp Interaction under the supervision of Dr Suhair H. Amer.

Purpose: The main purpose of this project is to make students learn the various types of Mono and Poly alphabetic Ciphers and the conversion of the texts from Plain to Cipher and vice – versa for each of them. The website describes each of the Cipher techniques and the clear process they follow for conversion from one text to other. The main motto is to make students clearly understand the way, technique, and the particular algorithm used by a particular Cipher Technique with the simple web application developed. They are provided with a text box to enter their desired text and corresponding buttons for “Encryption” and “Decryption” process. In short. A user can learn the following,
•	Introduction about Mono – alphabetic Ciphers,
•	Types of Mono – alphabetic Ciphers,
•	Introduction about Poly – alphabetic Ciphers 
•	Types of Poly – alphabetic Ciphers,
•	Information about a particular Cipher technique,
•	Encryption procedure,
•	Encryption Algorithm,
•	Decryption procedure,
•	Encryption Algorithm.
